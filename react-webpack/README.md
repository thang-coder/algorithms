#### React

This website is intended to demonstrate algorithms. React's virtual DOM could help in making CSS animations easier when an algorithm runs.

To run the website, use one of the following commands:

```
# Start for development
npm start # or
npm run serve

# Start the dev-server with the dist version
npm run serve:dist

# Just build the dist version and copy static files
npm run dist

# Run unit tests
npm test

# Auto-run unit tests on file changes
npm run test:watch

# Lint all files in src (also automatically done AFTER tests are run)
npm run lint

# Clean up the dist directory
npm run clean

# Just copy the static assets
npm run copy
```
